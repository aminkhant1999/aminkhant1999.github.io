# 🎮 Mini Games Hub (Portfolio Project)

A collection of simple browser-based mini-games — **Card Memory**, **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Rock–Paper–Scissors**, and **Snake** — built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES6)**.

This project demonstrates my front-end development skills, problem-solving, and ability to structure clean, maintainable code.  
It also highlights my understanding of responsive web design, DOM manipulation, and game logic fundamentals.

## 💡 About This Project

I created these games with the help of **AI assistance (ChatGPT)** as part of my personal learning journey.  
All code was **reviewed, tested, debugged, and modified by me** to improve logic, structure, and user experience.

My goals for this project:
- Strengthen my **HTML/CSS/JS** fundamentals  
- Practice **responsive layout** and **accessible UI design**  
- Learn how to **translate ideas into code** efficiently using AI collaboration  
- Build a **public portfolio** showing practical skills beyond tutorials
