# 🎮 Mini Games Hub (Portfolio Project)

A collection of simple browser-based mini-games — **Card Memory**, **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Rock–Paper–Scissors**, and **Snake** — built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES6)**.

This project demonstrates my **front-end development** skills, problem-solving ability, and clean, maintainable code structure.  
It also highlights my understanding of **responsive web design**, **DOM manipulation**, and **game logic fundamentals**.
